                <p>Tsang Tsou Choi (aka. King of Kowloon), 
                    was an artist who wrote Chinese calligraphy 
                    throughout the streets of Hong Kong, 
                    beginning in 1956. </p>
                <p>Convinced of his royal 
                    lineage, Tsang adopted the namesake 
                    "King of Kowloon" and for nearly 60 years 
                    railed against the British and Hong Kong 
                    governments who he believed had robbed 
                    him of his kingdom.</p>
